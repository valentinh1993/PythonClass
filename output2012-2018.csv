The plane completely broke up, burst into flamesand came to rest in Hussain Abad Village. The crew were trained to fly the Boeing 737-200 but not the more advanced 737-236 which features an automated flight deck. The aircraft accident took place as a result of combination of various factors which directly and indirectly contributed towards the causation of accident.The primary causes of accident include, ineffective management of the basic flight parameters such as airspeed, altitude, descent rate attitude, as well as Page 75 of 78 thrust management. The contributory factors include the crew?s decision to continue the flight through significant changing winds associated with the prevailing weather conditions and the lack of experience of the crew to the airplane?s automated flight deck;127;23167/1074;127;4;2012;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1

All 37passengers, 6 crew and 2 Sukhoi officials were killed. Pilot error. The TAWS had sent a 'terrain ahead' warning , followed by six 'avoid terrain' warnings before the crash. The pilot in command switched the TAWS off, assuming there was a database problem. In addition, the flight crew were distracted by a customer in the cockpit and failed to complete a planned turn.

(passengers:2? crew:1);While en route, the crew of the chartered flight radioed they were making an emergency landing at Masbate Airport due to engine problems. The airplane then crashed into the sea and broke apart off the shores of Masbate Island some 980 ft away from the island's airport. An investigation found that improper maintenance led to the right engine suffering an internal failure, which likely would have caused misfiring and intermittent operation of the fuel pump. The failure was gradual and the aircraft developed engine problems 23 minutes after take off. However, instead of turning back to Cebu, the pilot decided to continue the flight, until the engine failed completely, 37 minutes later and the aircraft crashed during the subsequent attempt to land at Masbate. The investigation determined that the pilot didn't use the correct procedure for trying to land a Piper Seneca with one engine inoperative, in that he lowered the undercarriage and flaps too soon and that during his last flight proficiency test he had not been tested with respect to flying with one engine inoperative. 4 34-7350051 3 08 2012 0.75 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Wreckage was discovered on Saturday with the pilot and copilot fatally injured. The aircraft was badly fragmented in three sections. The flight crew's failure to maintain terrain clearance, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain in instrument meteorological conditions. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's failure to correctly read back and interpret clearance altitudes issued by the air traffic controller, their failure to adhere to minimum altitudes depicted on the published instrument approach chart, and their failure to adhere to company checklists. Also contributing to the accident were the air traffic controller's issuance of an ambiguous clearance to the flight crew, which resulted in the airplane's premature descent, his failure to address the pilot's incorrect read back of the assigned clearance altitudes, and his failure to monitor the flight and address the altitude violations and issue terrain-based safety alerts.;2;UC-17;2;3;2013;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

(passengers:3? crew:0);"The aircraft crash landed short of the runway while on approach to runway 28L at San Francisco International Airport. The tail section, landing gear, and both engines separated from the fuselage and a fire erupted. Debris was scattered from the ocean front to the runway to where the aircraft came to rest. The plane's voice and flight data recorders show that the aircraft was coming in too slow and too low and that the pilots appear to have increased speed seven seconds before impact. A stall warning sounded four seconds before the crash, and the crew then made an internal decision ""to initiate a go-around 1.5 seconds to impact.Two passengers were killed and 182 injured. One passenger was run over by one of the emergency vehicles. The crew's failure to monitor and maintain the plane's airspeed, and its failure to abort the landing when in trouble. The pilot and co-pilot reasonably believed the automatic throttle would keep the plane flying fast enough to land safely, when in fact the auto throttle was effectively shut off after the pilot idled it to correct an unexplained climb earlier in the landing. The flight crew over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand.";307;29171/553;3;7;2013;0.0098;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Before contact was lost, the pilot requested a route change due to weather conditions. Preliminary indications are the plane ran into poor weather and stalled from FL320. The rudder travel limiter faulted 3 times during the flight. On the fourth fault the captain decided to try resetting the system by pulling circuit breakers as he had seen a maintenance technician do on the ground. This caused the autopilot to disengage causing the plane to bank 54 degrees. The the first officer, who was flying, became disoriented and was slow to correct the bank. He then put the plane into a steep climb that caused the aircraft to stall and eventually crash.
